Dylan Simon's custom mrxvt

This is "drxvt", based entirely on mrxvt, but with some optimizations,
enhancements, and many simplifications.  A number of features from mrxvt have
been eliminated, including, strangely enough, tabs (I find tmux is a much
better solution for that).  Only the things I use are left.
