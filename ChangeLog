0.5.2 to 0.5.3
\-----------------------------------
Gautam Iyer <gi1242@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Bug Fixes:
	1. Handle EIO errors (got when tcsh / fish exit) properly. Patch by
	   Zoltan Szalontai.
	2. Disabled Shift+Enter shortcut by default, since it may confuse new
	   users.
	3. Make Alt+Enter behave like Xterm.
	4. Added %T,%G,%P flags for percent interpolation (useful for dtach).
	5. Bold colored text is rendered in BOTH bold font, and bright color.
	   Use only bold font.
	6. r->num_fds is properly reduced when tabs are closed
	7. Ignore focus events of type NotifyGrab and NotifyUngrab. This
	   caused an annoying blinking when focussing other windows via the
	   keyboard. (Thanks to Roman Po??ízka for pointing this out).
	8. Removed the --focusDelay option (no longer necessary with above
	   bugfix).

    * Enhancements:
	1. Added --titleFormat and --winTitleFormat options to control display
	   of tab and window titles.
	2. Added options --veryBright and --boldColors to control how bold
	   primary colors are rendered.
	3. Added --useFifo option, to make mrxvt listen for macros on a fifo.
	   Code based on patch by Jozef Vesely.
	4. Added Raise macro to "raise" the mrxvt window. Thanks to Jozef
	   Vesely for the patch.
	5. Added a UseFifo macro to enable / disable --useFifo at runtime.
	   Defined a macro that opens a "mrxvt console" in a new tab (bound to
	   Ctrl+Shift+c by default). Added --enable-use-fifo compile time
	   option for people paranoid about security.
	6. Added BOLD_BRIGHTENS_256_COLORS option in feature.h which attempts
	   to brighten even non-primary colors instead of drawing them in
	   bold. (Respects boldColors and veryBright).
	7. Made winTitleFormat a profile option.
	8. Added -ic option to set the application icon. (Adapted from patch
	   #1656294 by Stanislav Mekhanoshin)

Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Enhancements:
	1. Check locale for encoding method if it is not specified by -km
	   option or multichar_encoding resource.
	2. Add new debugging facility such that a user can specify the
	   message type and verbose level by command line options. Run
	   `mrxvt -dmask whatever -dlevel something' for details. 
	3. Fix compile error when use Sun Studio 10. Thanks to Quintin
	   Beukes for the patch.


0.5.1 to 0.5.2
\-----------------------------------
Gautam Iyer <gi1242@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Bug Fixes:
	0. Did a HUGE REWRITE of the multi-tab code base. Incomplete escape
	   sequences longer cause lockups. Really busy tabs no longer starve
	   everything else!
	1. Fixed detecting xft support if xft-config is missing.
	2. Fixed segfault obtained when the last macro in r->macros is executed
	4. Convert sources from ts=8 to ts=4. Yes ts=8 was a bug :). Added a
	   script ts4to8.pl to do this.
	3. Make text under cursor visible if cursorcolor2 is not defined.
	5. Added "Exec" macro to execute external programs
	6. Added % expansion to macros. %s=selection, %t=tab title, %n=tab#.
	7. Added a menu option to open the selection in a new tab in mutt /
	   w3m, or in firefox.
	8. Implemented a "-into" option to embed mrxvt into. Thanks to Bruno
	   Deferrari <utizoc@gmail.com> for the patch.
	9. Fix buffer overflow. Thanks to Frederik Deweerdt <deweerdt@free.fr>
	   for the patch.
       10. Made -ufbg and -fade options work under Xft ;).
       11. Font specified with --boldFont is correctly handled (even if it's
	   of a different dimension).
       12. Exited tabs are now correctly held. Output from them is not lost
	   even if they exit very quickly.
       13. Rewrote the -ufbg and focus fading code completely. Now works
	   correctly if tabs are switched on on unfocussed window, or if the
	   bg is changed (via an escape sequence) from an inactive tab /
	   unfocussed window.
       14. Removed round trip to server when allocing Xft colors. (Reduces
	   protocol requests by about 750 on startup, which should speed
	   things up on a slow connection).
       15. Defined CURSOR_COLOR_IS_RENDITION_COLOR by default in
	   src/feature.h. This makes the cursor better visible when the cursor
	   color is not defined, and makes the behaviour similar to the
	   default behaviour of Xterm.
       16. BugFix: Str and Esc macros caused a beep on execution.
       17. Updated examples / menus to use new word splitting.
       18. When user closes the mrxvt window, don't forcefully exit. Instead
	   send SIGHUP to all child processes, and wait for childs to exit.
	   Previous behaviour caused problems if the child produced some
	   output on SIGHUP, or took a few seconds to exit.

    * Enhancements:
	0. Really busy tabs (even with Xft+anti aliasing) no longer starves
	   anything else!
	1. Reduced memory footprint by roughly 5kb.
	2. Converted all source files to use the standard ts=8 for easier
	   diffing / online viewing.
	3. Added a --focusDelay option to collect focus changes events over an
	   interval. This is mainly to work around a bug in some window
	   managers.
	4. Xft bold fonts now actually use the bold font, instead of over
	   striking.
	5. Added a --xftBoldWeight option to control the weight of the Xft
	   bold font.
	6. Made --holdExit a string option, so that tabs can be held based on
	   the exit status of the child.
	7. Added --holdExitTitle and --holdExitText options to specify the
	   title of an exited tab, and the text printed in the tab of an
	   exited child process.
	8. Removed the "jumpScroll" option, and replaced it with
	   --refreshLimit and --skipPages (see man page).
	9. Changed word splitting of commands executed via NewTab and exec
	   macros. Now words are split only at spaces or tabs (unless
	   backslashed). If command starts with "!", it is passed to /bin/sh
	   -c, which does all the word splitting / executing. For the old
	   behaviour define INERNAL_WORD_SPLIT in src/feature.h.

Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Bug Fixes:
	1. Fix mrxvtset.pl as pointed by Avi Yagodnick.
	2. Fix mouse button 4/5 behavior. Make it the same as firefox
	   as pointed out by Yoshihiko Kashio.
	3. Fix reverse video when foreground/background colors are not
	   defined. Thanks to Yoshihiko Kashio.
	4. Disable slave macros in the macro chains if the first (master)
	   macro is defined as dummy.
	5. Fix off-focus fading. Thanks to Ken Zalewski for the report.
	6. Add macros to check and set options. Extend the number of 
	   options.
	7. Add macros to check and unset X resources.
	8. Add macros to check and set NULL pointers.
	9. Fix some freeing NULL pointer issues.
	10.Fix black and white icons. Thanks to William Poetra Yoga
	   Hadisoeseno for the patch!
	11.Lots of code cleanup in command.c:rxvt_cmd_getc. Previously
	   it is lengthy and nearly unmaintenanble.
	12.Fix round-robin algorithm of command.c:rxvt_find_cmd_child.
	13.Fix crash if click on empty space of menubar. Thanks to Zhu
	   Qunying for the patch.
	14.Fix severl compile error - we must call DBG_MSG after variable
	   declaration in functions as we are using C, not C++. Thanks to
	   lzl@mitbbs.com for bringing this issue to me and provide patch.
	15.Fix unclosed file descriptors in child process.
	16.Fix session support. We actually did not listen on it because
	   the number of open file descriptor is small - we did not count
	   it!

    * Enhancements:
	1. Add --with-max-profiles to configure script as suggested
	   by Avi Yagodnick.
	2. Add experimental fast (hopefully) memory management code. It
	   is disabled by default.


0.5.0 to 0.5.1
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Bug Fixes:
	1. Compile error at rxvt_free_clipping (screen.c) when XFT
	   support is not enabled.
	2. Fix typo in acute acent. Thanks to Benedikt Magnusson
	   for the bug report.
	3. Fix file descriptor leakage - we should close /dev/ptmx
	   after forking. Thanks to Edgar Toernig for the report
	   and patch.
	4. Always show cursor while mrxvt loses focus. Thanks to
	   Edgar Toernig for the patch.
	5. Adjust several limits, e.g., max border width and min
	   blink time according to Edgar Toernig's patch.
	6. Fix rpmbuild (Sourceforge Bug #1482311)
	7. Fix crash on OpenBSD 3.9 when MULTI_CHAR is enabled -
	   the variable morecur (defined as char) in screen.c is
	   treated as unsigned (WtF!).
	8. Fix compile error on OpenBSD 3.9 when MULTI_CHAR is
	   enabled (OpenBSD keeps playing game with us!).
	9. Saving session behavior now conforms to profile support.
	10. Apply patches from FreeBSD ports.
	11. Fix crash on Solaris when calling XLookupString. Xlib
	   manual states that a portable program should pass NULL
	   to the last (compose) parameter.
	12. Add mrxvt 0.4.x compatible keyboard combinations to 
	   mrxvtrc. They are disabled by default though. Thanks to
	   Mihail Zenkov for the report and Dimitri AT sun.com for
	   the solution.

    * Enhancements:
	1. Enable multiple bold fonts. Thanks to Edgar Toernig for
	   the patch.
	2. Add Fink package build. Thanks to Jeremy Anthony for the
	   submission.

Gautam Iyer <gi1242@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Bug Fixes:
	1. Macros now ignore the state of caps lock (as they should).
	2. The highlight flag is now set even if the tabbar is hidden (so
	   showing the tabbar will show which tab produced the beep).
	3. Macros without modifiers did not work. Fixed this.
	4. Ignore SIGHUP (caused exit when parent shell is killed).
	5. Ignore SIGPIPE (caused exit when print command crashes).
	6. Some Xft fonts, e.g., aquafont, report double the actual width.
           This cause some text being clustered together while the cursor
           and user input have double size. Test, and correct for this.
           Notice that this fix will work for fontconfig 2.3.2 (as we have
           tested) or later version, and you must run ``fc-cache -f'' after
           upgrading fontconfig. It will not work for fontconfig 2.2.3 and
	   earlier versions due to the bug of fontconfig.
	7. Also dump initial tab titles when the --cmdInitTabs options are
	   given (this used to cause incorrect behaviour when the user closes
	   tab 0, and opens a new tab).
	8. Fixed bug #1473987. (Jagged edges of screen fonts)
	9. Fixed bug #1357219. (Made bg changes via escape sequences sticky)
       10. Saved configuration file is now profile compliant.
       11. Setting the tab title via \e]0 behaves like \e]2 (i.e. honors the
	   macros SET_TAB_TITLE_ON_XTERM_SEQUENCE & SET_TAB_TITLE_NOT_WIN_TITLE
	   defined in feature.h). Previously only \e]2 would honor these
	   macros. To only set the window title, the new escape sequence \e]60
	   has been added.

    * Code cleanup:
	1. Made coding & comment style similar to that of Vim (works well with
	   Vim7's syntax folding).
	2. Removed --confFileSave option. It's no longer needed as the
	   SaveConfig macro accepts an argument.

    * Enhancements:
	1. Warn if closing mrxvt with multiple tabs (and the tabbar is
	   hidden).
	2. Code cleanup (OK. That's not really an enhancement for users)
	3. Update documentation.

    * New features:
	1. Changed the behaviour of the --vt%d.xx resources. The settings are
	   now tied to profile %d (as opposed to the %d'th tab). A new tab
	   with profile %d can be opened on demand, or on startup.
	2. Added option --initProfileList to replace -tnum. (Marked -tnum as
	   obsolete).
	3. Removed option --cmdInitTabs as it is no longer meaningful with
	   profiles.
	4. When the command specified via the --profile%d.command option is
	   prefixed with an '!', run the shell first and then execute the
	   command. Removed the --tabShell option (as the prefix with '!' is
	   more flexible).
	5. Macros can now be chained (i.e. you can execute upto 16 actions in
	   sequence with any macro).
	6. Made the print screen macro take a command argument. You can use
	   this to define a macro to open the scroll back buffer in less (for
	   instance) in a new tab, and search regexp's to your heart's content
	   :).
	7. Made the extra height of active tabs, and radius of tab corners
	   compile time options.
	8. Added a --workingDirectory (profile) option to set the working
	   directory of new tabs. Set to "." to use the cwd of the active tab.
	9. Added a ToggleFullscreen macro. (Use with --smoothResize enabled).


0.4.2 to 0.5.0
\-----------------------------------
Gautam Iyer <gi1242@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Bug Fixes:
	1. Bug #1301269: Make ACS graphics / line drawing characters work
	   under Xft.
	2. Bug #1337635: Made ColorBD/HL work under Xft.
	3. Fixed pseudo-transparency when the root background is tiled on the
	   desktop.
	4. Numerous fixes to options to match the documentation (see CVS
	   logs).
	5. Partially fixed "transparentForce" option (see man page).
	6. Enabled pointer blank under Xft.
	7. Fixed text shadow.
	8. Enabled Xft with menus.
	9. If we're unable to exec the shell (or command specified), print an
	   error message and exit gracefully. (Thanks to Eygene Ryabinkin).
       10. Fix crash after XIM quits. (Thanks to Gary Zhang for pointing it to
	   us, and attach the patch).
       11. Fix XIM preedit problems (Thanks to Yoshihiko Kashio for the
           patch), including:
           - wrong calculation of the preedit area size with hide/show 
	   bars
           - updating the size of the preedit area with resizing window
           - updating the fontset of the preedit area with changing
	   font size
           - the linespace of the preedit area is not configured
           - the preedit character is not drawn on the font baseline
           - clean up codes related to XIM
       13. Fix compile on cygwin by implementing strcasestr.
       14. Added a macro XTERM_KEYS to feature.h. If defined, then modified
	   function keys will send the same escape sequences as Xterm.
       15. Fixed DEC sequences sent by the numeric keypad.

    * Enhancements (Performance):
	1. Reduced memory (xresource) usage under pseudo-transparency.
	2. Made performance improvement to expose events (especially under
	   Xft). Dragging some other window over mrxvt no longer causes
	   any flicker :).
	3. Decreased CPU usage when not focused.
	4. Rewrote tabbar drawing routines to eliminate flicker on expose.
	5. Optimized screen drawing routine with "caching": Causes notable
	   performance improvement under Xft.

    * Enhancements (Appearance / Features):
	1. Updated documentation! (Includes shiny new almost complete man
	   page).
	2. Make tabbar apearence more intuitive: Use itabBackground instead of
	   tabBackground for the background of the tabBar so that the active
	   tab stands out better.
	3. Make highlighted tabs stay highlighted until activated.
	4. Fixed borderless windows (thanks to Jonathan Black for the patch).
	5. Added popup menus. Ctrl left/right click pops up menus.
	6. Right click on tabbar now pops a menu listing all tabs.
	7. Rewrote tabbar drawing routines. Tabs now have rounded tops. Also
	   made the active tab bigger than the others (like Konsole).
	8. When clearing the primary screen, we move the text into the
	   scrollback buffer (instead of discarding the information
	   completely). Thanks to Sabit Sayeed for the suggestion.

    * New features:
	1. Added option -htb (--highlightTabOnBell) to highlight inactive tabs
	   only when a bell sounds.
	2. Added option -mtw (--maxTabWidth) to set the maximum displayed with
	   of each tab.
	3. Added option --smoothResize to resize the window in pixel
	   increments instead of by char. Useful for fullscreen / maximizing.
	   Requires frills.
	4. Added option --fullScreen to make window fullscreen.
	5. Made feature --enable-smartresize into option --smartResize. Make
	   smart resize aware of window manager decorations. Requires frills.
	6. Added option -aht (--autohideTabbar) to automatically hide the
	   tabbar if there is only one tab, and show it if there are more than
	   one tabs open.
	7. Added a "hard reset" hotkey. Thanks to Pavel Gorshkov for the
	   patch.
	8. Added --enable-xrender compile time option to use XRender alpha
	   blending to tint the background under pseudo transparency.
	9. Enabling tinting transparent tabbar / menubar with their background
	   colors. Requires XRender.
       10. Added --bgRefreshInterval option specifying how long we should wait
	   before refreshing our background. This avoids laggy delays while
	   dragging the window.
       11. Added hotkeys ScrollHome and ScrollEnd to scroll to the beginning
	   and end of the scrollback buffer. Bound these by default to
	   Shift+Home and Shift+End.
       12. Added option -xftpfn and -xftpsz to specify the name and size of a
	   propotionally spaced font for the tabbar / menubar.
       13. Added support for Firefox like tabs: All tabs have the same width,
	   and they shrink as tabs are added. Requires xftpfn
       14. Added option -mvt to determine the minimum number of tabs to keep
	   visible.
       15. Added CloseWindow hotkey and escape sequence.
       16. New tabs now open in the current working directory of the active
	   tab.
       17. The "hotkey" feature from mrxvt-0.4.2 has now been replaced with
	   a "macro" feature. This reduces the code size slightly, and
	   provides added functionality.
       18. Implemented a "ToggleMacros" function to toggle using keyboard
	   macros. Renamed options "-dh" and "-ddh" to "-dm" and "-nsc"
	   respectively.
       19. Added feature to move tabs by dragging.

    * Code cleanup:
	1. Removed the SCROLL_ON_* features. These can all now be implemented
	   using hotkeys.
	2. Cleaned up menubar code.
	3. With -xftpfn the menus now look good :). And you have your precious
	   Control right click menu from Xterm.
	4. Changed default scroll bindings to only work on the primary screen.
	5. Fixed code indent (and added lots of comments) in lots of places.
	6. Removed compiled in keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl-+ font resizing).
	   This can be done with macros, and the macros method provides added
	   flexibility.
	7. Removed support for getting resources using the X resource
	   database. Now resources are only read using ~/.mrxvtrc.

    * Incompatible Changes:
	1. Tinting works differently with XRender. See -tint in the man page.
	2. The default terminal is now "rxvt" instead of "xterm". This causes
	   trouble on some systems where the "rxvt" termcap / terminfo entries
	   are not correctly setup.
	3. The old "hotkey" feature has been removed. Use the "macro" feature
	   instead.
	4. Mrxvt menus are now incompatible with rxvt. Mainly because the
	   menu-action works similar to the macro actions, which extends the
	   functionality of the old rxvt menus.
	5. Quite a few escape sequences controling tabs have been disabled for
	   security concerns (e.g. creating, closing and moving tabs). All
	   these functions can be accessed through macros, and menus. (The
	   idea is that only interactive users should have access to these
	   functions. 'cat'ing a text file with these escape sequences should
	   not produce such effects.
	6. A few default bindings were changed for consistency (and might be
	   changed again).

Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    fix bug under XFT that ColorBD/ColorHL are ignored (Sourceforge
	Bug ID# 1337635). Thanks Gautam Iyer for the patch.
    fix screen flicker behavior when pseudo-transparency is enabled
	and mrxvt is off-screen. Also fix a BadMatch error. Thanks
	a lot to Gautam Iyer for the clear explanation of the problem
	and his nice patch.
    fix code of highlighting inactive tabs when they receive some
	output. Add an compile option HIGHLIGHT_TAB_ON_BELL into
	feature.h (disabled by default) so that inactive tabs are
	only highlighted when they receive bell. Also make highlight
	bold. Thanks Joshua Wise for the suggestion and patch.
    fix hot key parsing. Primary flag should not be checked like
	ctrl/meta/shift flag.
    fix button click action on tabbar based on Mark Olesen's patch.
	Now scroll-up and scroll-down clicks (Button4 and Button5)
	will active the previous/next tab. In addition, only clicks
	of Button1 will activate the button functions.
    fix hotkey handler to kill a tab according to Mark Olesen's
	suggestion. That says, if there is only one tab left, we
	shall not kill it to quite the entire terminal. This behavior
	is the same as gnome-terminal.


0.4.1 to 0.4.2
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add question of emacs hotkey and answer in FAQ.
    add option to load application icon, not implemented yet.
    fix display problem when both bottomTabbar and hideTabbar are
	enabled (Sourceforge Bug ID 1299309).
    fix signal sent to child process when quit a page. We now send
	SIGHUP instead of SIGKILL to be more graceful.
    fix compile error on OpenBSD 3.7.
    fix missing iconv library on OpenBSD 3.7.
    fix prematurely stop of tab title sequences on ^C. Thanks to
	Johann 'Myrrkraverk' for the report and patch [Sourceforge
	Bug ID 1211691]. If any of you dislike the patch, please
	blame Johann instead of me. ;-)
    fix default 256 colors. When XTERM_COLORS is defined, we use the
	same colors as xterm. Thanks to Gautam Iyer for the patch.
    fix trailing space in selection by porting Marius Gedminas's
	patch for rxvt - we will not copy trailing space in mouse
	selection. Thanks to Mun Johl for pointing me the patch.
    fix 64-bit bugs reported on debian
    fix default maximal number of tabs to 15.
    fix configure.ac. Revert back the LINUX_KEYS check (disable it)
	since it causes lots of complaints. :p  I think LINUX_KEYS
	mean to use Home/End keys as Linux console. But X terminals
	like mrxvt are different.
    add a new configurable X resource for Linux console style Home/End
	keys instead of fixing it in the source code.
    fix rxvt_process_hotkey interface, simplify it by eliminating the
	three mask variables.
    fix escape sequence of F1 - F4. Now we introduce a *magic* check
	to determine the terminal type at run-time and send correct
	escape sequence accordingly. To support this feature, we also
	introduce a new escape sequence to let user tell mrxvt that
	terminal type has changed at run-time. To be clear, normally
	user changes the TERM environment variable in shell. However,
	this change is not visible to mrxvt! So the user must tell
	mrxvt that the TERM environment variable has been changed using
	this new escape sequence. Thanks to Johann Oskarsson for the
	report and patch.


0.4.0 to 0.4.1
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add mrxvt.spec file based on Jingyu Zhou's work. This file is used
	to build RPM packages.
    fix Korea encoding according to rxvt sourceforge bug id 1181825.
    fix tinting on Window Manager other than WindowMaker.
    fix dead key support. Add a hack to enable dead key manually. User
	must press dead key twice or press dead key and space to input
	the characters of dead keys themselves. This is a temporary
	solution. It may be changed in future release. To enable this
	feature, define USE_DEADKEY in feature.h. Thanks to wwp for
	all the help on this issue.
    fix infinite loop on Solaris when a child exists. Thanks to Sunil
	for the patch.
    fix cursor color is rendition color by applying William P. Y.
	Hadisoeseno's patch. But disable it in feature.h by default.
    fix FAQ of Home/End key question.
    fix malloc function check in configure.ac, and apply a patch to
	rxvt_malloc when the size is 0. On Tru64/OSF, malloc(0) returns
	NULL pointer. We want to avoid this behavior. Thanks to Teun
	Burger.
    fix crash when saveLines exceeds 65535, hopefully.
    fix help message. Print it to stdout instead of stderr.
    fix lots of compile warnings, thanks to Teun Burger for the report.
    fix compile problems on Tru64/OSF based on Teun Burger's patch.
    fix manpage of hotkey inhibit options.
    fix manpage of special hotkey symbols.
    fix freezing with mc in bash when viewing a file in tar files. This
	is because the read syscall blocks when trying to read more
	data from the child process. Strange problem since it seems 
	good in tcsh. [Sourceforge Bug ID: 1103548]


0.3.13 to 0.4.0
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add option tabShell in order to execute shell before running tab
	command in the tab. Thus the tab will not quit if the tab
	command exits.
    fix definition of macro LINUX_KEYS based on luohui's suggestion.
	We define the LINUX_KEYS macro if the OS probed by the 
	configure script is Linux. Thus, we can use Home/End key to
	reach the beginning/end of a command line. (But it seems not
	effective on my system :-()
    fix option and resources for tab sessions. Now we change them to
	tab commands to avoid confusion with X session. Notice that
	all resource names and command line options related to each
	tab have been changed! In particular, follow these:
	    mrxvt*vt%d.session -> mrxvt*vt%d.command
	    mrxvt*cmdAllSession -> mrxvt*cmdAllTabs
	    mrxvt*initSession -> mrxvt*cmdInitTabs
	    -vt%d.ss -> -vt%d.e
	    -cs -> -at
	    -is -> -it
    fix question about synchronizing tab title to current directory
	for C shell in FAQ based on Nicholas Carrasco's solution.
    fix default terminal type in configure script. Change it from rxvt
	to xterm to avoid wired bash behavior for very long command
	line. Thanks to Luohui for the report and digging out the
	solution.
    fix core dump if the child process quits too fast. In this case,
	read syscall returns -1, but we didn't handle it carefully
	and moved cmdbuf_endp backward!
    fix typo and man page for key bindings according to Elan Ruusamae's
	suggestion.
    fix off-by-one byte buffer overflow when parsing the X resources
	using XrmGetResource [Sourceforge Bug ID: 1117722].


0.3.12 to 0.3.13
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add configure option --enable-minimal to only enable minimal
	number of configuration options. So people who want a slim
	mrxvt can simply their configuration command line.
    add escape sequence to change bgfade degree at runtime.
    fix xdefaults.c. Merge Grant McDorman's patch that correctly
	handles the vt%d.BlahBlah resources. Many thanks to Grant!
    fix input buffer filling case. It means that there is space in
	the beginning of the input buffer, but no space at the end
	of the input buffer. In this case, we can move the content
	of the input buffer forward to free space.
    fix input buffer overrun in rxvt_cmd_getc. The input buffer size
	should be (BUFSIZ-1 - (cmdbuf_endp - cmdbuf_base)) instead of
	BUFSIZ!!! Thanks to Carsten Menke for reporting the bug.
    fix the missing -sm option in session management restart command.
    fix compile error of xfticonv if iconv.h is not found. This seems
	to be a common problem on Cygwin for some Chinese users. So
	if your mrxvt can display CJK text using X11 fonts, but not
	XFT fonts, check whether HAVE_ICONV_H is defined in config.h
	when you compile mrxvt!
    fix tab number when saving terminal status in session management.
	Ooooops, we miss the first tab whose index is zero!!!
    fix leakage of the highest file descriptor to child process. In
	the past, this can be considered as a potential security bug.
	But, only in theory... :p
    fix tab moving behavior when move first tab to left or last tab
	to right. Disable the moving in these two cases because they
	are too complicated to code correctly. :p [Sourceforge bug id
	1107773]
    fix behavior of xterm escape sequence of setting terminal window
	title. We also set the current tab's title so that if the user
	"set titlestring=%f" in ~/.vimrc, the current tab's title is
	set to the opened file as well. I have found it very useful
	to browse among multiple tabs that have different files
	opened. If you do not like this behavior, uncomment the macro
	SET_TAB_TITLE_ON_XTERM_SEQUENCE in feature.h.
    fix behavior of xterm escape sequence of setting terminal window
	title. We introduce a new macro SET_TAB_TITLE_NOT_WIN_TITLE
	to avoid setting window title at all. This is used to help
	vim since vim restores the window title using old window
	title when it exits. This can be annoying - try it and you
	know the reason. If you do not like it, uncomment the macro
	in feature.h.
    fix poor response speed of the active tab if there are busy
	activities in the inactive tabs. Now in rxvt_cmd_getc, we
	first try to return the active tab if it contains input data.
	If there is no input data in the active tab, we process the X
	events to see if they can push input data into the active tab.
	If still not, we return other tab that contain input data. If
	all tabs have no input data, we select on all tabs and then
	pick a tab to return. This is a major fix that delays our
	0.4.0 release. But hey, we want a stable 0.4.0, right?!
    fix tab lockup. It happenes when a tab is particular busy, thus
	the tabs on the right side of this tab are locked up.
    fix configure script: fix check of the utempter, xpm, jpeg and
	png options, fix default option of mouse slip wheel and
	ttygid.
    fix pseudo-transparency when opacity is not enabled.
    fix compile error when utmp is disabled.
    fix manpage for the description of %d.


0.3.11 to 0.3.12
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add option to enable/disable X session management, compatible to
	Xterm.
    add hotkey function CopySel and PasteSel to copy and paste
	selection. The CopySel function is used to copy the selection 
	in current terminal to the X clipboard, but it is not yet
	implemented. The PasteSel function is used to past the 
	selection in current terminal or the X clipboard into the
	terminal. It is working now. But be careful that define it
	as Ctrl_v may break something! For example, in vi, you might
	want to replace the character ^M, which requires you to type
	in Ctrl_v and Ctrl_m.
    add meta key Primary so that a hotkey can be disabled when the
	terminal is using the secondary screen. This is useful for
	the above problem (Ctrl_v).
    fix X properties, merge them into global Atom array r->h->xa[].
    fix setting terminal window title. Now we support UTF-8 terminal
	titles, which makes it work when we use multichar strings as
	terminal title.
    fix half shadow configuration option, show its value only when
	rxvt scrollbar is enabled.
    fix help message for modes, make them consistent.
    fix resource name in man page. Replace XTerm.ResourceName with
	mrxvt.resourceName to avoid confusion.
    fix resource name of backspace key, delete key, selection style,
	and print pipe. Standardize them as other resource names.
	This will break old rxvt style resource names, but cause
	less confusion.
    fix random bold text under XFT. We disable the bold XFT font in
	order to fix it. This should be a temporary solution.
    fix rxvt_clean_exit. Kill all child processes there since zsh
	puts them into background if we do not do so. Thanks to
	Rob Eberts for the patch.
    fix slow scrolling when XFT antialiasing is enabled. We just
	disable screen refresh at all on scrolling. Now scrolling is
	super fast, e.g., takes about one second to `ls -l /usr/bin'.
	I guess it probably is the fastest in the world.  But there
	is no visual effect of scrolling any more. There is not a
	perfect world, right? :p
    fix poor performance of mouse wheel scrolling when XFT antialiasing
	is enabled. Basically, we just disable screen refresh on
	scrolling. Thanks to Jacques Bouchard for the report.
    fix missing mouse wheel scrolling macros in feature.h.
    fix compile error when mouse wheel is defined.
    fix meta8 and mouseWheelScrollPage option. Now they can be enabled
	by command line options.
    fix cutChars resource and its man page option. Thanks to Ashish
	for the report. 
    fix scrollTtyOutputInhibit man page option. Thanks to Ashish
	for the bug report.
    fix missing parameter when calling rxvt_scr_move_to under
	SCROLL_ON_HOMEEND_KEYS feature. Thanks to Ashish for the
	report.
    fix rxvt_get_pty. Avoid potential compile error for C compilers.
    fix mrxvtset.pl. Replace the control character (^[) with its
	digital forms to avoid the side effect if a user accidently
	cats the script in shell.
    fix configure.ac. Non-GNU C compilers like SUN's cannot accept
	-Wall and -fPIC options.
    fix rxvt_init_hotkeys. Use ANSI_C compliant function instead of
	GCC extension. Thanks to Grant McDorman for the patch.
    fix Cqual qualifiers, non-gcc compilers do not support it. Thanks
	to Grant McDorman for reporting this issue.
    fix possible integer overflow in throttle bell. Also comment out
	this feature in the feature.h.
    fix crash on XftPatternDestroy if we change the font size in
	reverse order, e.g., increase the font size then decrease
	it. It seems that we should not destroy the pattern returned
	by XftFontMatch. But there is no documentation to explain it
	clearly! :-(
    fix rxvt_save_options. Do not save undocumented features :p
    fix keyboard deadlock when Shift_Home (increasing font) is pressed,
	and XIM is enabled, but XIM is not successfully opened. This
	is because the same keyboard events are filtered away by
	rxvt_cmd_getc.
    fix button pixmaps. Narrow the width of the pixmaps so that it
	is the same as the height.
    fix iso8859 fonts. We will only use iso8859-1 fonts as default
	fonts.
    fix multichar encoding routine. Since we set the default encoding
	method (MULTICHAR_ENCODING) in config.h anyway, there is no
	need to *guess* the encoding method from locale if user has
	not supplied it in command line option or X resources. Now
	the encoding routine should be much more clear and simple.
    fix multichar encoding list.
    fix session restart style, pw init value and callback functions.
    fix session restart parameters.
    fix man page for the mfont resource case problem.
    fix compile error because the const definition of ttydev.
    fix configure script for the missing check of limits.h. It is
	required on cygwin.
    fix xdefaults-sample.txt, giving example to disable tricky hotkeys
	that are used by emacs.
    fix drawing button frame. Now the buttons should seem more pretty.
    fix shortcut key bindings of Shift_Home and Shift_End.
    fix rxvt_hotkey_save_config. If HOME environment variable is not
	defined, do not call rxvt_save_config.
    fix rxvt_Exit_signal, call rxvt_clean_exit directly instead of
	sending the signal again to the default signal handler. They
	should have the same effect, but the fix may avoid hanging
	the terminal.


0.3.10 to 0.3.11
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add Avi Yagodnick's perl script to print escape sequence for
	manipulating mrxvt runtime behavior. So users need not to
	compile the sample settitle.c any more if they have a perl
	interpreter.
    add command line option -ddh to avoid loading default hotkeys.
    add escape sequence to toggle hotkeys.
    add option disableHotkeys to disable hotkeys.
    add option confFileSave and hotkey to save the configuration of
	current running mrxvt process.
    fix default jumpScroll threshold. Increase it to 4 in order to
	get better scrolling performance.
    fix veryBold font option. Use veryBold font by default because of
	the panic screams from the users. ;-)
    fix plain scrollbar residual pixels under transparency. Thanks to
	Matthieu Serrano for the bug report!
    fix off-focus fading wired behavior. It is because the foreground
	and background color of GC is not updated in the function
	rxvt_set_bg_focused. Therefore, the following text is drawn
	using the old color till a color change happens later.
    fix X session management crash.
    fix file descriptors leak to the child processes.
    fix mrxvt hangs on zsh if session management is enabled: we need
	to prevent the file descriptor opened by session manager from
	being leaked to the child processes. And there is a race
	condition when we handle the ICE file descriptor while the
	terminal exits.
    fix broken configure options (oooops! nobody has reported these
	problems ;-).
    fix compile error when tinting is disabled but fading is enabled.
    fix scrollTtyOutputInhibit.
    fix hotkey routines. We optimize it by using function pointers and
	merge three individual flags into one integer. Thanks to
	Qingning Huo for the suggestions.
    fix compile error on rxvt_init_font_fixed if xft is disabled.
    fix the name of icon files and description file in mrxvt.SlackBuild
	script.
    fix documents.


0.3.9 to 0.3.10
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add Scognito's beautiful icons for mrxvt. Now mrxvt has official
	icons! :-)
    add Pascal Bleser as SuSE package maintainer.
    add a new option to synchronize icon name with active tab, based
	on Terry Griffin's patch.
    add hotkey and escape sequence to toggle background transparency.
	This feature is experimental, though. It may not work well
	with tinting and other transparency related features.
    add .mrxvtrc as the default resource file, so that .Xdefaults is
	not filled by mrxvt settings any more. ;-)  Update all the
	documentations according to this change.
    add xftmSize option to specify the size of freetype multichar
	fonts. When it is difficult for mrxvt to find the best match
	of normal font and multichar font size, the user can adjust
	it manually.
    add xftSlowOutput option to fix display problem of some CJK fonts,
	like YZYuanTi. These fonts claims to have certain width, but
	the actual width is smaller. It makes the CJK characters
	clustered together with big space between non-CJK characters,
	which looks ugly.
    add -menu option. Now we can use -menu command line option besides
	of the X resource name to load menu.
    add hotkeys (Ctrl+Shift+<|>) to reorder active tab. Thanks to 
	Sergey Popov for the suggestion and patch.
    add escape sequence to reorder active tab.
    add an option (-vbf) to display color text with bold font. Add
	freetype bold font support as well.
    add hotkey and escape sequence to toggle very bold font display.
    fix hotkey routines. Now we define a set of functionality that can
	be done by hotkeys and let the users to define the hotkeys by
	themselves. We also have a set of default hotkeys. Thanks to
	Qingning Huo for all the hints and suggestions.
    remove windowSwitch option since it is not necessary any more.
    fix transparent screen refresh after the pixmap of root window has
	changed.
    fix default encoding method, change it to noenc to avoid troubles
	for non-multichar users.
    fix rxvt_font_init_xft. Only load the fixed font if xft is used.
	This avoid the abort when multichar is enabled, but fallback
	X11 fonts are not installed.
    fix rxvt_cmd_getc. Previously hack of race condition is incorrect,
	so it does not work at all! It is actually not a race
	condition, but a signal loss problem if multiple children are
	killed simultaneously. This time it should be fixed.
    fix configure.ac script. Replace AC_PATH_XTRA with AC_PATH_X. The
	latter does not add libXt, libICE automatically. Add libX11
	check. Fix fontconfig and xft check, especially for Solaris.
	And many thanks to Qingning Huo for testing and pointing out
	the problems in configure.ac.
    fix MONO_BOLD definition in thai.c.
    fix tabbar multichar string display error, especially when normal
	text and multichar text are mixed together.
    fix scrollTtyOutput inhibit. Instead of using the previous reverse
	definition, change it to scrollTtyOutputInhibit.
    fix menubar dispatch. If menubar is shown or hidden in dispatcher,
	resize the terminal window accordingly.
    fix CJK configuration options. Merge them into a single option:
	--enable-cjk.
    fix session restart style. Previously it is SmRestartImmediately,
	which cause gnome session manager to restart it immediately
	after an mrxvt terminal quits.
    fix FAQ. Update the PS1 tab title synchronization question
	according to Jacques Bouchard's suggestion.
    fix background pixmap command line option for menubar and tabbar,
	make them consistent to the option of scrollbar.
    fix tabbar event dispatcher when tabbar buttons are hidden.
    fix resource name of scrollbar options. Stuart Midgley pointed
	out this issue to me in the man page. Now the resource name
	of all scrollbar options are changed to `scrollbarBlahBlah'.
	Notice that here `scrollbar' is in lower case. However, I
	leave the option scrollBar unchanged, where `B' is in upper
	case.
    fix Ctrl_1..9 switch. If the current tab is in the second screen,
	like running vim, Ctrl_1..9 switch is disabled since it may
	be used by the application.
    fix primary screen check in tabbar.c, explicitly use PRIMARY. Do
	NOT assume it is 0, just like None/NULL check since it is
	more safe and portable.
    fix configure.ac, xgetdefault option is disabled by default.
	(Thanks to Terry Griffin for pointing it out to me)
    fix configure.ac, enable SM.h check only if session management
	is supported. Otherwise, we may get linking error if libSM
	is not presented while SM.h is there (is it possible?).
    fix configure.ac, enable libICE check for session management and
	libiconv on cygwin, simplify check of libxpg4 and libutil.
    fix freetype font size, set scale number to be 1.0 so that the
	size/pixel_size = 1.0.
    fix freetype multichar font size, optimize for simsun font.
    fix debian files according to Qingning Huo's diff file.
    fix compile error in pixmap.c when tinting support is disabled
    fix Makefile.am, comment out setuid install hook such that mrxvt
	will not be installed as setuid by default in the future for
	security concern.
    fix SlackBuild stript, we will use .tar.gz as source tarball name
	instead of .tgz. It seems all the world use it.
    update FAQ, CREDITS, README and NEWS.


0.3.8 to 0.3.9
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add a VB script (doc/mrxvt.vbs) to launch mrxvt directly from a
	Windows shortcut without a command prompt window for Cygwin
	users. This script is contributed by Matthew Melendy
    add option to hide/show tabbar buttons. apparently some people
	hate the buttons, as some others hate the tabbar ;-)
    add hotkey and escape sequence to hide/show tabbar buttons
    add further explanation of --enable-everything option in README
    add option of user supplied X resource file
    add option to avoid loading mfont when using freetype font, this
	can avoid large line space
    add escape sequence to change tab colors in runtime
    add support of X session management, still experimental
    add a short tutorial in doc/ directory on how to hack mrxvt and
	add new features
    add inactive tab highlighting when an inactive tab displays some
	new stuff. Remember that is not 100% persistent: it will be
	cleared if an tab expose event happens, e.g., creating a new
	tab or removing an old tab. But I guess it is enough by now.
	If people really concern about it, we can add a flag to each
	tab and use that flag to control the highlighting. But that
	might be overkill.
    fix printing of hold exit string on the screen after a child has
	died but is held
    fix borderless option, now support GNOME/KDE style hints
    fix bug in loading short command line option while long resource
	option is set to NULL, like -d
    fix freetype font size, turn back to point size instead of pixel
	size
    fix freetype multichar font loading. If the multichar font is the
	same as the normal font, e.g., when encoding method is NOENC,
	we use the normal font as multichar font. This eliminate the
	problem that the two fonts have different sizes. But this
	problem remains when the two fonts are different. This is
	because XFT function does not honor the font size we provide.
	Is there any way to fix this?
    fix internal border, which should be the internal border of the
	VT windows, not the mrxvt terminal window!
    fix computing of first visible tab and last visible tab. Now use
	a function to do it so that we can call this function outside
	of tabbar.c, especially when we hide/show tabbar buttons
    fix tab title width. Extend it to 507 maximal, but only display
	27 characters maximal in tab. Therefore, if we synchronize
	the terminal title with tab title, we can display the long
	tab title as terminal title without truncation.
    fix debian files (thanks to qingning huo)
    fix xft font opening routine, print warning message when actually
	opened font differs from the font wish to open
    fix pty/tty type check on BSD system - they require openpty that
	is in libutil. Why it seems unnecessary to fix it on FreeBSD
	5.2.1?
    fix error logic on updating previous active tab when we create
	tabs in sequence and remove them from the right to the left
    fix tabbar updating error if the last tab is removed
    fix include and library path on BSD systems
    fix compile error on macro PARENT_NUMBER if transparent is disabled
    fix compile error if scrollbar is not used
    fix int-border and ext-border option comments
    fix copyright information about rxvt-2.7.10-rk.patch
    fix missing lastlog file path on Solaris
    fix missing lastlog.h check
    fix tainted/untainted macros, use Cqual's notation so that we
	may use Cqual to check the source code in the future. It
	seems gcc compiler is happy with them. But I am not sure if
	other compilers feel happy too. :-)
    fix missing fontconfig macros on Mac OS X
    fix crashes on Mac OS X when calling times with NULL parameter
    fix iconv library check on Mac OS X
    fix xft tab title mixed chinese and english
    fix default gbk bitmap font
    fix terminal window and icon title if user supplies them
    fix assert macro (NDEBUG) on non-debug mode. Now if NDEBUG is
	defined, we will not have any assertions nor debug messages.
	If DEBUG is defined, assertions will always be built in the
	program, and we can use DEBUG_VERBOSE to control the debug
	message. By default, DEBUG_VERBOSE is not defined. So now it
	is clean to build mrxvt with debug support.
    fix SlackBuild script
    fix man page, add X resource name for each command line option
	if applicable
    delete unused rxvtRef-frame.html and rxvtRef-toc.html
    update LSM.in, FAQ, CREDITS, README and NEWS


0.3.7 to 0.3.8
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add option windowsSwitch to control behavior of Ctrl_Tab. If it is
	set, Ctrl_Tab switches to next tab like Windows. Otherwise, it
	activates the previous active tab.
    add xftfnmono flag if non-CJK font is mono-space
    add holdExit option and holdExitText resource on terminal exit
    add support of broadcasting input to all terminals
    add hot keys to toggle holding exit and broadcasting
    add desktop option for gnome compatible window manager
    add text shadow mode
    add option of transluscent window (true transparent). It requires
	translucent support of the X server, like Xorg 6.8. It will
	override the pseudo-transparency. Note: without hardware
	support to the X server, translucent window can cause
	significant performance penalty. You have been warned!!!
    add debian control files to build .deb package. Thanks to Xiong
	Jiang for help me figure it out.
    add checksum field to each terminal for checking rxvt_cmd_getc
    fix debug option, disable it by default since we are preparing a
	stable branch
    fix global command input and output buffer, move them to individual
	terminals. This may break something, so let us test it for a
	relatively long time.
    fix children exiting and clean code, so we can handle the case
	that multiple children terminals exit simultaneously. But a
	race condition still exists and this code is not robust
	enough. Is there any way to handle this?
    fix sigchld handling, enable reentrance of this signal handler
    fix configure check of iconv.h and libiconv for freetype font 
	support
    fix compile error when background image is disabled while xpm is
	enabled
    fix scrollbar style so that user can use command line option to
	specify it
    fix rxvt_set_window_color to restore and switch colors when input
	color is actually an index to our color list.
    fix shade value if it is changed by escape sequence
    fix xftmono flag if the width of freetype CJK font is not even
    fix xft font height when mfont and font have different height
    fix xft string drawing length after convert it to UTF-8
    fix compile error when there is no xft support
    fix an assertion failure on possible integer overflow
    fix tinting shade performance: if shade is 0, do not shade image
	at all
    fix global rvideo, rstyle, chstat, lost_multi and multi_byte, move
	them to individual terminals
    fix the bug that the background color of current VT is tranferred
	to the new VT window
    fix scrollbar mapping after scrollbar window is created
    fix free clip rectangle of tabbar string
    fix crash when trying to free session resource strings
    fix xterm style reverse video
    fix compile errors on openbsd


0.3.6 to 0.3.7
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add experimental support to display Chinese/Japanese when use
	freetype font.
    add experimental support to display non-monospace freetype font.
	Basically, if the font is non-monospace (or normal freetype
	font width is not 1/2 of Chinese/Japanese freetype font),
	we will output the string one character by one character,
	not the entire string. This is a bit slow, but much safe.
    add option of multichar freetype font
    add option of cursor blinking interval time
    add option of borderless window (from gentoo)
    add option of override redirect (from gentoo)
    add option of bell command (from gentoo)
    add option to show tabbar at the bottom of terminal window
    add configure script and related files. We are preparing for a
	stable release soon
    add support of text shadow for tab title
    add hotkey to hide/show menubar/scrollbar
    add ctrl_tab as hotkey to activate next page (like Windows)
    add escape sequence to hide/show menubar/scrollbar
    change text shadow command line option
    fix desktop option/resource for WindowMaker
    fix color residual problem when switch to a new tab
    fix buffer overflow in rxvt_tt_printf (from gentoo)
    fix sprintf in xdefaults.c
    fix EUCJ/SJIS encoding (http://gentoo.nedlinux.nl/distfiles/
	rxvt-2.7.10-rk.patch)
    fix Next/SGI style scrollbar width (too fat before)
    fix selection on 64bit systems (from suse)
    fix utmpx check for Interix (from netbsd)
    fix bsd os check (from netbsd)
    fix window properties, use X11R4 (and later) functions
    fix window resizing code
    fix compile dependency on Xt header
    fix reverse video on individual terminal foreground/background
    fix tabbar button vertical position
    fix cursor blinking
    fix pointer blank
    fix possible integer overflow when calling rxvt_malloc
    fix focus/off-focus color code
    fix fade/shade values, previously they are reversed
    fix SlackBuild script
    update README and FAQ


0.3.5 to 0.3.6
\-----------------------------------
Jimmy Zhou <jimmyzhou@users.sourceforge.net>
    add xft antialias, hinting, autohint, globaladvance, weight,
	width, size, slant and rgba options
    add option syncTabTitle to synchronize terminal title with tab
	title
    add support to set foreground and background for individual
	terminal. It does not work well with off-focus fading now

    add hotkey and escape sequence to hide/show tabbar

	since many people have requested this feature :-)
    add support to run user's default shell in the /etc/passwd file
	if the SHELL environment variable is not defined
    fix mouse report mode (hopefully) by moving PrivateModes and
	SavedModes from global to individual terminal
    fix default PrivateModes by removing PrivMode_aplKP. It seems
	that vim clears this flag anyway. However, if anything goes
	wrong, we will restore it
    fix configure.ac, use xft-config instead of pkg-config to find
	xft since some systems do not have pkg-config
    fix configure.ac for xft-config's complaint about rejection by

	destroy it, which wastes some system resources.

Oezguer Kesim <kesim@math.fu-berlin.de>
    removed DONT_GUESS_BACKSPACE. Instead, you may define either
	    FORCE_BACKSPACE or FORCE_DELETE or leave both undefined

	'erase'
    fixed positioning of text in the top menubar.
    fixed some missing #define's
    fixed conditions for MONO_BOLD in scr_refresh() to make

2.21a3 to 2.21b*
\---------------
     1. From: Conrad Link <conrad@akira.resnet.rochester.edu>
    Fixed a bug in the OffiX Drag and Drop support.
    rxvt inserted two instances of directories or links when they 
    were dropped onto rxvt.
    
     2. From: <aner@zenith.att.com>
    Fixed a bug that makes rxvt getting constantly "NoExpose" events
    which it is not handling.

     3. From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
    Fixed a bug that caused rxvt to hang indefinitly waiting for a 
    terminating ^G on an XTerm `ESC]' sequence.

     4. From: Bernard PERROT <perrot@lal.in2p3.fr>
	  Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
    Fixed a bug that prevented to handle DEC VT2xx's ApLineDel correctly

     5. From: <vikas@insight.att.com>
	  Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
    Now the Shift/Ctrl cursor key mappings are enabled regardless of
    App-Cursor settings

     6. From: Kai Petzke <wpp@mail.physik.TU-Berlin.DE>
    Fixed a bug with respect to cursor movement. rxvt now handles the
    'G' and 'd' sequences correctly

     7. From: Geoff Wing <mason@primenet.com.au>
    Fixed a couple of things in utmp.c 

     8. From: Denis N. Antonioli <antonio@ifi.unizh.ch>
    Added the "-tn" option and corresponding Xresource variable "termcap".
    This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the
    TERM environment variable. 

2.20 to 2.21a*
\-------------
     1.	Oops, forgot to include time headers in menubar.c

     2.	Finally got the correct DEC sequence to toggling the behaviour
    of the backspace key and removed the other non-standard ones.
    If anyone has a listing of DEC escape sequences they'd like to
    donate ...

     3.	Fixed a bug that prevented an XPM file from being found if it
    were specified with an absolute path and a geometry string.
    Made the default scaling zero (tiled) since this is by far the
    most popular use.

     4.	The Motif-style scrollbar is back as a compile-time option.

     5.	Added BUGS file and (thankfully) moved coordination of the
    project to Oezguer Kesim <kesim@math.fu-berlin.de> who also
    has a mailing list for rxvt development

    Rxvt Workers <rxvt-workers@math.fu-berlin.de>

    To subscribe to the list send email to
    <rxvt@math.fu-berlin.de> with the body: subscribe

     6.	Semi-retirement and finish my thesis ... bye for now - /mark

   --- Oezguer started working on rxvt

     7. Fixed a bug in the new menubar-feature. There were several unchecked
    strings strcpy'ed which caused rxvt immediately to dump core.

     8. From: Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe@orcus.priv.at>
	Fixed a bug in rclock.c which prevented it to compile correctly.

     9. From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Overstrike boldfonts and pixmaps now work together without pixel
	droppings on the screen (at least under Linux).

    10. From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
    Modified autoconf support: memmove() replacement function
    supplied for those systems that need it, libXpm should now be
    correctly found (set in src/Makefile *not* in config.h)

    11.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
    Converted doc/rxvt.ref to HTML format.
	doc/html/refer.html = master copy
	doc/refer.txt  = text version saved using Netscape.

    All HTML documents are put in here, to ease installation
    elsewhere.

    12.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
    Moved some file search function from main.c and some string
    functions from xdefaults.c to misc.c.

    Changed the implementation details so that `keysym' resource
    is also available as a command-line long option ... even if
    you have compiled with USE_XGETDEFAULT.

    13.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
    When a new pixmap is loaded, revert to the default scaling.

    14.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
    Reworked the menubar to permit multiple menubars in a circular
    linked list (and all the management functions that entains)
    and new functions including the following:

	* reading from files
	* dumping all the menubars
	* clearing a menu (without removing it)
	* setting a backgroudPixmap
	* and many other features.

    The menu syntax has changed very slightly from the last
    version, but now provides greater flexibility ... see
    refer.html for details.

    Added the `menu' resource/long-option so a startup menu
    can be specified. eg,
	rxvt -menu my.menu -e rlogin machine -l user

2.19 to 2.20
\-----------
     1.	You can now add snazzy looking menus to any plain (non-X) text
    application.  At the moment, the menuing system is simple but
    functional.

    The syntax for controlling the menubar is documented in
    doc/rxvt.doc, but note that an XTerm sequence `ESC ] 10; Pt
    BEL' is used so menus created for rxvt will be ignored by an
    ordinary XTerm.

    It provides sub-menus, click-and-drag, and even some user
    definable `quick' arrows keys.  However menu manipulation
    could use refinement to permit multiple menus to be defined --
    and the menu refreshing could also use some improvement, but
    it can be extended and refined later as required/desired.

    The files doc/menu.sh and doc/jedmenu.sl show sample
    implementations of menus.

      -->   It compiles and runs on my machine (AIX 3.2.5)
	but THIS IS CONSIDERED BETA (or even ALPHA) CODE!

     2.	DEC private modes: Bug fix for 's'ave and 'r'estore parameters,
    added a 't'oggle parameter to DEC private modes.

     3.	Made Backspace key selectable with DEC private mode
    ESC [ ? 36 h/l/s/r/t (high/low/save/restore/toggle)

     4.	Changed the way the scrollBar is realized to permit on-the-fly
    toggling of the scrollBar display and added a DEC private mode
    escape sequence for that.  Smoother redraw of scrollBar.
    Better proportions for the arrows allows a slightly narrower
    scrollBar.

     5.	Added support for XTerm font changing sequence:
    `ESC ] 50; Pt BEL', with (as usual) a few extras.
    See doc/rxvt.ref

     6.	Adapted experimental XPM buffering from that supplied by
    Carsten Haitzler <raster@zip.com.au>.

     7.	Replaced `wait' with `waitpid' in src/command.c::Child_signal
    to avoid a race condition and permit use of pclose() on SunOS.
    Patch provided by <davis@space.mit.edu>, Thanks John!

     8.	For easier XPM handling, added `path' resource/long-option and
    substantially enhanced pixmap scaling to provide very exact
    control over scaling and positioning of the XPM background
    image.  The XPM XTerm escape sequence has been extended to
    provide a convenient facility for on-the-fly rescaling.
    Export COLORTERM="rxvt-xpm" instead of COLORTERM="rxvt"

     9.	Added export COLORFGBG to give hints to color applications.
    Typically one of these values is exported, in which `fg' and
    `bg' are numbers 00-15:

    COLORFGBG="default;default"
	-fg -bg colors don't match any of color 0-15

    COLORFGBG="fg;default"
	-fg color matches color 0-15, but -bg color doesn't

    COLORFGBG="default;bg"
	-bg color matches color 0-15, but -fg color doesn't

    COLORFGBG="fg;bg"
	-fg -bg colors match color 0-15

    When compiled with XPM support, the last two values are
    rendered as follows:

    COLORFGBG="default;default;bg"
	-bg color matches color 0-15, but -fg color doesn't

    COLORFGBG="fg;default;bg"
	-fg -bg colors match color 0-15

    10.	Disable Shift+Prior/Next and scrollBar if saveLines == 0.
    Slight change to key-processing so `shift+meta+key' and
    `shift+ctrl+key' gets processed as `shift+key'.  This provides
    a way to avoid interpretating `Shift+Prior', `Shift+Next', and
    `Shift+Insert'.

    Also, added DEC private mode sequence `ESC [ ? 35 h/l/s/r/t'
    to disable Shift+key interpretation.

    Provide for Ctrl+Shift+<KEY> combinations for function keys.
    See doc/rxvt.ref

    11.	Always match long-option names, even when only preceded by a
    single -/+.

2.18 to 2.19
\-----------
     1.	Minor alteration to input mode for Kanji processing.

     2.	rclock: -adjust option, support for exec on startup syntax,
    date format may now also include the century

     3.	Made mouse double-click respect autowrap lines.

     4.	Added marks for folded editing.

     5.	Added Offix DND (Drag 'n' Drop) protocol.
    Added support for XA_TARGETS.

     6.	added Carsten Haitzler <raster@zip.com.au> XPM patches to load
    an XPM file for the background of the terminal window.
    Uses resource `Rxvt.backgroundPixmap' or long-option
    `--backgroundPixmap'

     7.	Use these (XTerm) keybindings exclusively and remove the old
    equivalent bindings:
	Shift-Prior  = scroll up
	Shift-Next   = scroll down
	Shift-Insert = paste mouse selection

	Shift-KP_Add	  = bigger font
	Shift-KP_Subtract = smaller font

2.17 to 2.18
\-----------
     1.	Check for NULL pointers in command-line processing (oops)
    Also fixed processing of `hidden' arguments such as -d, -g, -T

     2.	Fixed terminfo hpa/vpa: was `\E..' instead of `\E[..'
    added invisible cursor (ESC[?25h / ESC[?25l)

     3.	Fixed broken kanji characters (?? and disappeared cursor box ??)
    thanks to <manabe@Roy.dsl.tutics.tut.ac.jp>

     4.	In privileges(), changed setuid/setgid to seteuid/seteguid so that
    it's possible to switch back to root later.

    Perhaps fixed svr4 problems (reports no tty, no job control) in
    get_tty() ... need to detect these SVR4 features in the configure
    script.

     5.	Restored scrollColor, topShadowColor, bottomShadowColor resources
    that somehow got lost between the beta and release versions.  For
    monochrome displays, fixed scrollbar so it will be visible and
    suppress color changes.

     6.	Final? iteration on selection.  Store selection text with LF
    line-endings but paste into rxvt with CR endings.  Selection now
    preserves the newline when trailing space is stripped from
    non-autowrap lines.  Compile-time support for using a keystroke to
    paste from the cut-buffer.

     7.	Fixed utmp.c to handle both sysv and bsd pty names.  More changes in
    the works to improve documentation and eliminate race conditions ...
    this, thankfully, is being done by someone else.

     8.	Added European language support (X11R6) - let me know of problems
    and fixes since I only have X11R5.

     9.	Changed names of color10-color17 to color8-color15 to match with
    those used by color_xterm ... sorry for the inconvenience, but I
    didn't have an X11R6 xterm manpage until now and long-term
    compatibility is quite important.

    Added a real bold font (define USE_BOLDFONT).  I still think it's
    too much work to avoid pixel droppings for overstrike fonts.
    Added support for specifying colors for bold/underline
    (colorBD/colorUL) but it's only done when the foreground = the default
    foreground ... see the manpage.

    Compile-time selection of TERM="xterm-color".

    Reduced the number of rarely-used command-line options since they
    are accessible on the command-line via their resource names as long
    options.  More rigid differentiation between long and short options:
    long options are --/++ prefixed; short options -/+ prefixed.  Added
    long-option help to give the resource names.
    Removed run-time selection of right-hand scrollbar and arrows.
    Removed run-time selection of (pageup_key/pagedown_key/alert_key).

    10.	Changed Ctrl-Up,Down,Left,Right to emit "\EOa,b,c,d" instead of the
    previous "\E[^A,^B,^C,^D" to avoid problems associated with having
    an embedded "^C" in a key-sequence.  Disallow 80/132 column
    switching as the default (same as xterm).

    11.	Check for seteuid().  Add "ttcompat" module for SVR4.

    12.	A few people suggested removing the keystroke for toggling MapAlert
    and so I have.  I agree that it was pointless and/or annoying since
    there was no way of determining the current toggled state anyhow.

    13.	Fixed missing `ttydev' for _sgi.  Fixes for BSD utmp support.
    Exported WINDOWID before the window was created (oops).

    14.	Mouse cut&paste of autowrapped lines should be improved, fixed
    bug in screen.c::scroll_text().

    15.	As was pointed by a user -->> in keeping with X conventions, only an
    application that starts with 'x' should capitalize the first two
    letters of the resource file, so the rxvt resource file (and class
    name) should be named Rxvt not RXvt, this is a minor point.

    16.	rclock: As well as message reminders, rclock can launch programs and
    (if no message text is given) act as a cron-type of program.  Made
    default font `7x14'.  Fixed graphics context when mail is waiting
    and a reminder is issued - so the message is actually visible!

    17.	As suggested by a user, changed the bolding algorithm to be slightly
    more intuitive:
	1. colorBD (if specified)
	2. color0-7 -> color8-15 (if possible)
	3. boldFont (if specified and found)
	4. overstrike (last resort)

    This takes advantage of the color capability and is the most
    consistent when toggling font sizes on-the-fly.  If you never want
    overstrike (looks ugly and leaves pixel droppings) or boldFont (you
    like to switch font sizes on-the-fly), you can remove them at
    compile-time.  The other elements are similarly compile-time
    selectable.

    18.	Another user suggestion: scrollbar made more distinct by having the
    `trough' a different color from the slider -- I opted for making it
    the same as the default background color so that the slider and
    arrows appear to `float' on the window.  Also removed topShadowColor,
    bottomShadowColor resources as unnecessary.

    19.	Dropped distribution of vttest since Tom Dickey <dickey@clark.net>
    is working on an improved version.

2.16 to 2.17
\-----------
     1.	Fixed problem in scr_refesh_region() that was introduced in v2.16
    The problem of `pixel droppings' continues when bold is simulated
    using overstrike.  Using XCopyArea() sometimes helps, but the
    preferred and simplest solution is item 4 below.

    2.	Removed 7bit mode.

    Changed definition of meta so that the ESCAPE is the default and
    using meta to set the 8bit on an option that can be made run-time
    configurable (assuming people still use this).

    Added -/+rv command-line option, resource reverseVideo.  NB: it works
    slightly differently from xterm's in that foreground/background are
    swapped even if they have been explicitly set.

    Removed NO_COLOR option -- no more monochrome rxvt (one too #ifdef's).

    Inherit existing stty settings (at least for control characters)
    and set value of BackSpace appropriately.

    Added defines DONT_GUESS_BACKSPACE and NO_DELETE_KEY

    3.	Added 3D style scrollbar and removed all the old bitmapped
    scrollbars and arrows with the only exception being the xterm
    lookalike XTERM_SCROLLBAR which is available in a single width.
    With arrows, scrollbar behaviour somewhat resembles Motif
    behaviour.  Without arrows, it's the standard xterm behaviour.

    The default scrollbar (defined at compile-time or set by using
    scrollBar: True) is to have a scrollbar with arrows arranged on the
    right-hand side. The scrollBar resource is now exclusively a boolean
    value

    scrollbar resources:

	scrollColor
	topShadowColor
	bottomShadowColor

    NB: if topShadowColor/bottomShadowColor are unset, their values are
	calculated from scrollColor using an algorithm adapted from
	fvwm so it shouldn't be too hard to find scrollbar colours that
	look good with your window manager and don't consume an entire
	colormap.

    4.	Added smarter handling of bold/blink when applied to the default
    fg/bg colours:

    If the pixel value of fg/bg matches the pixel value of colour COLOR0
    through COLOR7, then applying bold/blink to the default fg/bg will
    select the appropriate colour from BOLD0 through BOLD7 instead of
    using the overstrike bold.

    This seems to be the best way to handle bold/blink attributes when
    the foreground/background match and ANSI colour anyhow.  For
    convenience, it is possible to use colour aliases (next item) for
    the foreground/background colours instead.

    My preference is a dull Canadian look:

	RXvt*foreground:    7
	RXvt*background:    10

    5.	Changed colour aliases (item 7 of last change) and dropped the `#'
    prefix.  This avoids confusion with the regular #rrggbb format of
    specifying colours and is unambiguous since there are no X11 colours
    starting with a digit.  This also avoids the need to quote the `#'
    to protect against shell interpretation.

    6.	Added colour cursor support.
	-cr (cursorColor), as per XTerm -> the (rectangle) cursor colour
	-cr2 (cursorColor2), only RXvt -> the text colour.

    The cursorColor2 maintains contrast in a colour environment and
    is optional.

    Thanks Raul Garcia Garcia <rgg@tid.es> for the idea.
    Cleaned up scr_refresh (again <sigh>) to avoid some unnecessary
    colour changes and removed the reverse video graphics context and
    just swap foreground/background colours instead.

    7.	Typo in command.c: had seteuid() instead of seteguid() <sigh>
    Use cfsetospeed()/cfsetispeed() for POSIX termios handling.

    8.	Ignore the loginShell option/resource for programs that DON'T end
    with "sh".  A hack but it keeps `rxvt -ls -e rlogin machine' from
    failing and I don't know of (m)any shells that don't end in "sh".

    9.	Hard-code dependencies in Makefiles to avoid using X11 makedepend.
    Added check for atexit() to catch the problem that exists on SunOS
    but not on Solaris.

   10.  Collected command-line option parsing and X11 resources into a
    single file (xdefaults.c), and introduced a monolithic structure
    (with bit-flags for logical options) to eliminate the massive
    if-else-if parsing and to reduce possible overlaps/oversights

    Short help provided for an incorrect argument.

    For more consistency, more flexibility, and fewer switches,
    made -grk4/-grk9 options obsolete, and replaced with `-grk mode'.
    Added the resource `greek_keyboard' while I was there.

    It is also possible to use a `--' or `++' prefix to get so-called
    `long options' that correspond to the resource name.
    For example,

	rxvt +ls -bg Blue
	rxvt +loginShell -background Blue
	rxvt ++loginShell --background Blue

	rxvt ++ls --bg Blue	Error!

   11.	Changed REFRESH_PERIOD to 1 in command.c, the old idea of providing
    for fast and furious scrolling needs to be reconsidered so that `cat'
    works.  Still needs some investigation.

   12.	Changed scr_poweron(), which corresponds to `ESC c', to also reset
    the scrollback buffer.

   13.	Changed scr_change_screen() (when compiled with NO_SECONDARY_SCREEN)
    so that switching from the secondary to primary screen will push the
    old secondary screen into the scrollback buffer.  This is fairly
    useful if your terminfo has have rmcup=\E[?47l\E8, smcup=\E7\E[?47h.
    It is NOT particularly useful if rmcup includes \E[2J, like some do.

    Running with NO_SECONDARY_SCREEN provides faster switching than
    with a real secondary screen and saves memory too.

   14.	Now that key values have mostly stabilized, moved the compile-time
    key choices to "feature.h" ("keys.h" now obsolete).

2.15 to 2.16
\-----------
    1.	Misc cleanup, rxvt once again passes the vttest (and reverse video
    works again).  Kanji support tested and seems to be okay.  Finally,
    an okay set of regular/bold colours.  Compile-time option for a
    right-side scrollbar.

    2.	Ctrl-minus now (correctly) generates ^_ [0x1F].
    Changed termcap/terminfo to use normal cursor keys instead of
    application cursor keys (rmkx/smkx, ke/ks) -- otherwise subsequent
    rxvt/xterm starts with the application cursor keys active.

    3.	Fixed scr_reset() so that resizing is a lot more sensible.
    Implemented the equivalent SouthWest resizeGravity (xterm X11R5) so
    the bottom line of text on the screen stays fixed.  If the window is
    made taller, additional saved lines will be scrolled down onto the
    screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will be scrolled off
    the top of the screen, and the top saved lines will be dropped. The
    old resizing code is available with -DOLD_UGLY_RESIZE.

    4.	Altered code so all man-page documented command-line options will
    not trigger errors even if the feature wasn't compiled into rxvt.
    Added old, backward compatibility command-line options, but they're
    simply ignored. Eventually they can be removed -- perhaps Jan'97?

	`-8':	    use `+7'
	`-fat':	    use `-sb'
	`-thin':    use `-arrows'
	`-meta8thbit'	use `-meta8'
	`-metaescape'	use `-meta'
	`-font_list'	use `-font1', `-font2', etc.

    These ones are just too weird to support:

	`-ls-':	    use `+ls'
	`-ma-':	    use `+ma'

    5.	Removed secure-keyboard option, too problematic and obscure.

    6.	First attempt at GNU autoconfig.
    Still needs some work, but it's mostly okay.

    7.	Added minor aliases for foreground/background colours.  This permits
    colour specifications like -fg "#13" -bg "#10", which would set the
    foreground to colour 13 (bright yellow) and the background to colour
    10 (bright black).  It's not terribly useful yet, but might
    eventually be a nice way to have bold/blink colour work even on with
    the standard fg/bg colours.

2.14 to 2.15
\-----------
    1.	Small bug: initial width incorrect when there was no scrollBar.

    2.	Close the gaping security hole.  Renounce setuid/setgid privileges
    immediately and only take them up as needed -- chown() or writing
    into /etc/utmp.

    3.	Reverted to using `<' and '>' to toggle smaller/bigger fonts. It
    seems that many didn't like KP_Subtract/XK_KP_Add -- conflicts with
    some editors, and not all terminals have a Keypad anyhow.

    4.	Man page reformatted by Piercarlo Grandi <piercarl@sabi.demon.co.uk>
    so that it "now is done in the most delightful [sic] elegant 'roff
    style :-)"

    5.	Started to integrate the Kanji support based on old patches from the
    Linux-JE (Japanese Extensions) project.  Consider it alpha until one
    of the JE authors gives it a thorough check.

    6.	Added compile-time selection of a few different scrollbar widths.

    7.	When reading X resources, rxvt now recognizes two class names:
    "XTerm" and "RXvt".  The reason for two distinct names is that there
    are many options common between rxvt and xterm -- to which the class
    name "XTerm" permits easy access and configuration -- but there are
    also several options, notably colours and key-handling, unique to
    rxvt but which are useful to share between different rxvt
    configurations; the class name "RXvt" permits this.

    NB: The "RXvt" class takes precedence (in the event of a clash) and
	is the only one ever used for the application defaults file.

    8.	The initial value used for the Backspace key (^H or ^?) is now
    determined from the value of CERASE used to set the termios
    structures.  This removes the need for the BACKSPACE_AS_DELETE
    compile-time option.

2.13 to 2.14
\-----------
    1.	Default HOTKEY prefix can now be choosen as `meta', `ctrl' or
    `shift'. Moved font toggle to KP_Add/KP_Subtract to resemble
    resolution toggling of the XFree86 server (Linux) and so that Alt-<
    can generate ESC-< for Emacs usage.  Man page and usage() reflect
    the changes. Note that if you choose the hotkey to be `shift', to
    mimic the Linux console scrollback, you'll probably want different
    keybindings for mapAlert and Secure.

    The choice of the HOTKEY (ctrl or meta) prefix and some of the
    key-strings can be compile-time defined in "rxvtkeys.h", although
    probably the only changes desired will be in the string value
    associated with XK_Delete and in the choice of a HOTKEY (ctrl or
    meta) prefix.

    Use shift or ctrl to temporarily toggle Backspace from ^H to ^?.
    Use shift to temporarily toggle the application keypad.

    2.	Patch so that setting bold or blink works before or after changing
    the colour (it used to only work before changing the colour). Also
    added the option of having DOS VGA colours.
    Thanks Avery Pennarun <apenwarr@foxnet.net>

    3.	Extensive reworking of pseudo-tty handling and addition of BSD sgtty
    terminal handling and new utmpx (Solaris 2.x) support. MANY thanks
    to Raul Garcia Garcia (rgg@tid.es).

    POSIX wtmp support added by Piet W. Plomp (piet@icce.rug.nl)

    Added -/+ut option (resource: utmpInhibit) so you can sometimes be
    harder to find :)

    4.	Finally? cleaned-up selection so that it works properly -- clears a
    previously selected region without causing a core dump -- define
    NEW_SELECTION.

    I believe that this should fix a long-standing problem with the
    selection mechanism -- probably back from when selection of the
    scrollback was added -- whereby all accounting was done in terms of
    screen row values [0 .. RxvtWin.rows-1] plus the current offset
    value.  The anchor and end points were scrolled with the screen, but
    the beginning point wasn't and extending a region that had its
    anchor scrolled-off would give complete garbage.  The new selection
    scheme has lots of bounds-checking (too much?) to prevent these
    problems.  If PRINT_PIPE is not defined, then you can use
    PrintScreen to dump some of the current selection state -- this
    should help debugging.

    Thanks to John Davis (davis@space.mit.edu) and Piet W. Plomp
    (piet@icce.rug.nl) for helping to diagnose the problem.

    5.	Use information request `ESC [ 8 n' to change the window title
    to the current rxvt version so you can find out what version you
    have.

    6.	Added simple code to permit run-time definition of the keysyms
    0xFF00 - 0xFFFF if KEYSYM_RESOURCE (for FAKE_RESOURCES only) is
    defined.  It's not as pretty as that used by xterm since it only
    works with keysym values rather that key names, but the impact on
    code size is quite minimal.  I use it in conjunction with `-name vm'
    to remap arrow and function keys for tn3270 ... quite handy.
    At the moment the string length is only limited by the line length
    (currently 256) used in "resources.c"

    The syntax (at the moment) is

	rxvt*keysym.0xFFnn: "a string value"

    where `nn' is a 2 digit hex value 00 to FF.  Of course if there were
    an easy and small means of converting key names to keysym values,
    then that would be better.

    The enclosing quotes are required to start/end with whitespace.
    Most of the usual escape values can be used:

	\b - backspace
	\e - escape
	\n - newline
	\r - carriage return
	\t - tab
	\000 - octal number

    Anyhow, here's a brief example of what it looks like
    in ~/.Xdefaults:

    ! F11 key - mimic the output of F1
    rxvt*keysym.0xFFC8: \e[11~

    ! F12 key - whatever
    rxvt*keysym.0xFFC9: Hello World!\n"\"String\" ends with whitespace  "

    ! Delete key - remap
    rxvt*keysym.0xFFFF: "Delete :)"

    !Scroll_Lock as flow-control (^S)
    rxvt*keysym.0xFF14: \023

    7.	Oops -- fixed resource name from scrollbar to scrollBar. Fixed
    cursor colours to black on white (like xterm) for the scrollbar
    cursors, but I've left the xterm (`I'-bar) cursor as foreground on
    background because it looks so nice.  Allocate all colours when
    creating the window so that we don't have to worry about it later
    and so that we can avoid potential hassles with colour-hungry
    applications like Netscape.

    8.  Added a way to distinguish an rxvt from an xterm via the obsolete
    ESC Z sending the vt100 answer string with 'c' -> 'C'.

    Added support for resolving the actual IP number of the host for
    remote DISPLAYs.  Changed the answer back for ESC[7n to add a
    trailing newline to support easier input into the shell.  When the
    display is local (i.e. :0), we add support for sending the first
    non-loopback interface IP number as the DISPLAY instead of just
    sending the incorrect ":0".  This way telnet/rlogin shells can
    actually get the correct information into DISPLAY for xclients.

    [Note: I've not had a chance to thoroughly test this -- mjo]

2.12 to 2.13
\-----------
    1.	Shift and Control now only work for non-application mode cursor
    keys and with function keys.

    2.	Override XTerm mouse reporting with either Mod1 or Shift.  X11
    mouse reporting now properly includes modifier keys (see rxvt.ref).
    Although this effectively degenerates to the Control modifier alone
    since both Shift and Meta are used to temporarily disable mouse
    reporting -- I don't know an easy way around this but that's what
    XTerm does, although since it uses Control to pop-up menus, that
    doesn't get transmitted either.

    3.  Moved a few more configuration items from Imakefile to configure.h

    4.	Added XAPPLOADDIR define to the Imakefile to allow use of the
    application defaults file XAPPLOADDIR/RXvt when rxvt has been
    compiled with FAKE_RESOURCES.  Now, the following files are
    checked:
	XAPPLOADDIR/RXvt    (compile-time defined)
	$HOME/.Xdefaults or $HOME/.Xresources
    suggested by John Gotts <jgotts@engin.umich.edu>

    5.	Applied patches by Edward D.H. Liu <dhliu@solar.csie.ntu.edu.tw>
    to fix the speed of pasting rxvt's selection to motif, xew or tk.
    Finally! reasonable pasting speed to these applications.

    6.	patches by Gregory Margo <gmargo@newton.vip.best.com>
    for xterm-style proportional scrollbar behaviour:
	If pointer is near top, scroll one line.
	If pointer is near bottom, scroll full page.
    refreshPeriod resource and -refresh option ... still wishing
    for faster screen refreshing.

    7.	Bug fix for partial matches (FAKE_RESOURCES).  In addition to
    resources for resource name `rxvt', also get resources for class
    name `XTerm' as well.  Remove checking for `command' resource since
    it's not found in xterm nor was there any code in place to parse the
    command arguments ... better just to use the command-line -e option.
    Replace `fontList' with font1, font2, ... etc. for better xterm
    compatibility and for ease of configuration.  Changed processing of
    string resources and command-line string options to avoid allocating
    redundant memory.

    8.	Previously selected region is now properly cleared when Button1 is
    pressed.  Still have problems with click-and-drag when Mod1 or Shift
    is used to override mouse reporting -- argh!  Until someone gets
    this properly patched, use Button1 followed by Button3 (to extend
    region) in these instances.

    9.	Understands ANSI set default fg/bg colour (\E[39m / \E[49m)

   10.	In the screen accounting used in screen.c, use a '\n' to terminate
    wrapped lines instead of '\0'.  This should avoid mouse selection of
    wrapped lines from including a bogus newline.  No known
    side-effects, but changes isolated by #define NEW_WRAPTYPE.

2.11 to 2.12
\-----------
    1.	Extra functionality for XTerm mouse report mode.  If mouse reporting
    is enabled (the application will handle mouse events) the normal
    scrollbar operation is disabled -- instead rxvt sends UP/DOWN for
    the arrow buttons and PageUp/PageDown when Button1 or Button3 are
    clicked on the scrollbar.  Use Mod1 (Alt) key to get the normal
    scrollbar/arrow button actions and also to get the normal selection
    functions -- so that you can still cut/paste between X applications.

    2.	New colour possibilities -- 16 colours.  Instead of using fatter
    characters, a bold attribute now uses a brighter foreground colour.
    Similarly, a blink attribute will use a brighter background colour.
    It is also possible to choose these colours through the resources
    (color0 -- color7) permit specification of the ANSI colours (black,
    red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white), the resources
    (color10 -- color17) are the brighter bold/blink equivalents.
    Define USE_FAKE_BOLD to disable.

    3.	Extensive clean-up of source and headers to separate
    interdependencies, remove unused variables.  Introduced static
    variables wherever possible to limit scoping and reduced the number
    of external variables.

    4.	Allow NumLock to toggle on/off the application keypad.

    Backspace sends '\b', Ctrl-Backspace sends '\177'.
    Define BACKSPACE_AS_DELETE to reverse these values or use the
    escape sequence:

	ESC [ 36 h	Backspace key sends BS
	ESC [ 36 l	Backspace key sends DEL

    XK_End used to send "\033Ow", which is identical to XK_KP_7 and
    confuses EDT-type editors. Now,
    Home = "\033[7~"
    End  = "\033[8~"

    Changed Alert & Secure keys from Alt-i & Alt-s to Alt-I & Alt-S so
    they aren't so easily toggled.

    5.	Extra keystroke info.  Pass Control and Shift indicators for
    function keys (similar to the XJed editor)
    eg,
	F1  = ESC [11~
	C-F1	= ESC [11^
	S-F1	= ESC [11$

    also, pass indication of shift status for arrow-keys
    eg,
	Up, Down, Right, Left
	  = ESC [A, ESC [B, ESC [C, ESC [D
	S-Up, S-Down, S-Right, S-Left
	  = ESC [a, ESC [b, ESC [c, ESC [d

    You wouldn't be able to use these keys for termcap/terminfo
    applications, but the key sequences are available for remapping
    within an application.

    6.	Added configure.h which is included by each source file and by the
    Imakefile.  Common compilation defines are now all contained in
    configure.h with minor system defines remaining in Imakefile --
    makes it much easier to configure.  Used XCOMM macro in Imakefile so
    that it actually works.  Also added defaults.h for defining
    user-specific startup defaults.

    7.	Added rxvt.ref to provide documentation of the various terminal
    sequences that are processed.  Updated man page to reflect changes.

    8.	Use xterm-style -/+ to turn on/off options, rationalized resource
    names to more closely resemble xterm.

	Option		Resource
	-help		-
	-display displayname	-
	-geometry geom	    geometry:

	-prkey keysym	    printscreen_key: <string>
	  		greektoggle_key: <string>
	  		cutchars: <string>

    9.	Fixed Button actions for XTerm-style scrollbar so that Button1 and
    Button3 do different things as they are supposed to.  Replace -/+fat
    with -/+sb and -/+arrows for more consistency with XTerm. Decreased
    width of `fat' scrollbar (make closer to xterm) and increased width
    of `thin' scrollbar (arrows too small) -- they are now the same
    width.  Also made it possible to remove the scrollbar altogether.
    Added a visual bell.

    Added many more defines to further reduce code size for various
    cases, see "configure.h".  It is also possible to alter settings in
    "defaults.h" for configuration options that will only affect
    screen.c and xsetup.c, this should help with compile-time
    customization for those who don't want to use Xdefaults.

    Added the define REPLACE_SELECTION_NEWLINE to make the substitution
    of newlines with carriage returns for selection pasting a
    compile-time option.

   10.	Fixed the graphics samples so that if you want to it's actually
    possible to compile them.  Added -name command-line option so that
    it's possible to select different sets of resources.

   11.  Integrated initial support for X11 mouse reporting and added
    Shift + Function Keys support.

2.10 to 2.11
    1.	If NEW_COLOR_MODEL is defined in screen.c, the new model I described
    in an earlier email is used. (apparantly there are two, slightly
    differnt models for using color extensions in a vt-compatible
    terminal. This flag lets you switch.

    2.	If XTERM_MOUSE_REPORT is defined in command.c, mouse reporting is
    turned on/off via the appropriate escape sequences.  XTerm already
    provides this support.

    3.	If .Xdefaults does not exist, .Xresources is searched for.  It seems
    that many here use .Xresources.

2.09 to 2.10
    1.	Really fixed the color problem (?) Got color-ls, and it works now.
    2.	Added patch to allow run-time selection of font list.

2.07 to 2.09
    1.	Fixed some color-usage errors.
    2.	Added double and triple-click support
    compliments of ah@doc.ic.ac.uk (Angelo Haritsis)
    3.	Added Print Screen capability, as in most vt-100's
2.06 to 2.07
    1.	Fixed problems with rxvt screwing up tty permisssions (?)
2.03 to 2.06
    1.	Fixed a limit which imposed a maximum width for the
    terminal window of 255 characters. There is no limit now.
    2.	Made provision for applications to get mouse-click feedback
    when user clicks in a graphics window. See graphics_sample
2.02 to 2.03
    1.	Fixed memory management just a little.

2.0 to 2.02
    1.	Bug fixes for color and graphics.

1.97 to 2.0
    1.	Added ANSI color support. Compile with -DCOLOR
    2.	Added a graphics mode. Compile with -DGRAPHICS
1.96 to 1.97
    1.	Bug in refresh() which was causing slow refreshes after
    clear-screens was fixed. Showed up during emacs start-up.

1.95 to 1.96
    1.	rxvt did bad things if it received mouse - Motion events
    without a preceeding button-press. Fixed.
1.94 to 1.95
    1.	Created a substitute for XGetDefaults, which seemed to account for
    1/2 to 2/3 of the memory used by rxvt (according to the SIZE field
    of ps output). My substitute only reads the .Xdefaults file. Compile
    with -DFAKE_RESOURCES to get my mini- XDefaults handling,
    -DREAL_RESOURCES to keep XGetDefault.

1.93 to 1.94
    1.	Fixed some minor long-standing errors in the vt100 emulation.
    2.	Fixed ALT-<char> handling in command.c
    3.	Fixed minor bug with start-of-selection location.
    4.	Added xterm-type "extend selection" feature using
    mouse button 3. Button 1 always starts a new selection. Button3
    tries to extend the current selection if possible.
    5.	Fixed problem with bold-face fonts overflowing into
	the next character for some fonts.

1.92 to 1.93
    1.	ran gprof to find bottle-necks in the code. Halved user
    time, but had little effect on total time required to
    update the display. Seems worth keeping for the more efficient
    user-time, though. At this point, I think that most of the elapsed
    time is spent waiting for input or waiting for the X buffers
    to flush.
    2.	Used to refresh the screen every 2.2 screen-fulls during
    flat-out scrolling. Really cuts down on scroll-time. Now,
    refresh every screen-full (or when there's a pause in activity),
    but when flat-out scrolling starts, decrease the refresh period,
    so that its every 10th screenful after a little while. This has
    no noticeable visible effect, since the scrolling text is
    absolutely unintelligible anyway, but will improve the scroll
    "feel" when doing just one or two screenfulls, ie in an ls -l.
    3.	Surrounded  the code which uses XCopyArea with #ifdef's
    I have never seen this help performance, but I think that there
    may be some video-systems which benefit from this, particularly
    in a full-screen editor or slow scrolling type of setting.
    4.	Performance in flat out scrolling, text only, on a sparc-10,
    displaying rxvt on an HDS x-terminal:
      nation@snoopy>/usr/bin/time rxvt -e cat k
	6.1 real	 3.1 user	 2.5 sys
      nation@snoopy>/usr/bin/time xterm -e cat k
	40.8 real	 4.6 user	 3.4 sys

1.91 to 1.92
    1.	Added greek-keyboard support patches.
1.85 to 1.91
    1.	assorted minor patches
1.82 to 1.85
    1.	Fixed ESC c handling.
    2.	Fixed minor selection handling bug.

1.81 to 1.82
    1.	Fixed slow refresh during selection process
    2.	Fixed problem of not correctly clearing selections of 1 character.

1.80 to 1.81
    1.	Fixed some scrolling problems, problems with partially obscured
    windows.
    2.	Added some neat debugging capability in debug.c
    3.	Patched up rclock.

1.74 to 1.80
    1.	Fixed core dump from selecting past the bottom of the screen
    2.	Fixed a few escape sequences, per the vttest program
    3.	Broke and fixed handling of moved/resize/new-font handling.
    4.	Still can't change tab stops correctly.
    5.	Ran vt-100 test suite. Added capability to change tab stops
    and enter reverse video, and to switch from 80 to 132
    columns and back. Fixed a seg-fault in scroll().

1.70 to 1.74
    1.	Fixed cursor drawing errors.
    2.	Improved smoothness of scroll-back operations.
    3.	Applied some SVR4 patches.
    4.	Applied HPUX patches, and a few cursor display patches
    5.	Fixed up font-changing routines a bit.
    6.	Fixed a scrolling problem for windows taller than the scroll-back
    buffer.

1.6 to 1.7
    1.	Fixed the problem with random rendition flags in the scroll
    back buffer
    2.	Fiddled with re-drawing on the scroll-bar, and with
    how often refreshing occurs.
    3.	Incorporated some AIX patches.
    4.	Included #ifdef'd changes to support vt100 printer.
    5.	Fixed send_string routine, so that it doesn't loose
    data.
    6.	Complete re-write of screen.c
1.5 to 1.6
    1.	Removed all use of a seperate bold font. Now uses
    over-striking exclusively.
    2.	Added some more optimizations for drawing speed when
    the window is re-sized or moved.
    3.	Implemented speed ups in screen.c

1.47 to 1.48
    1.	Cleaned up re-drawing on expose events, so rxvt only
    re-draws the newly exposed parts of the screen.
    2.	Fixed backspace, which must have broken in 1.45.
    3.	Added command line option of iconic startup.

from 1.45 to 1.47
    1.	Incorporated improved bsd utmp handling from
	dperry@ringer.cs.utsa.edu (David Perry)
    2.	Fixed a very minor bug where the solid-cursor can leave a
	a bit of a ghost when you resize the window. Its stupid,
    but it always bothered me.

from 1.4 to 1.45
    1.	Fixed scrolling error when switching to larger fonts
    2.	Fixed utmp-entry removal for SYSV type systems.
    3.	Icorportated patches for FreeBSD and svr4
