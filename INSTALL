			      Using GNU auto tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  If script `configure' does not exist, execute `bootstrap.sh' to generate
    it. To do so, you will need GNU automake, autoconf, and libtool.

    Notice on Solaris, automake and autoconf require perl to be installed in
    /usr/local/bin, but by default perl is installed in /usr/bin. You can make
    a symbol link of perl in /usr/local/bin.

2.  Run ./configure to generate config.h and the various Makefiles. ./configure
    --help gives a list of possible options with slightly longer descriptions
    in README.configure. A quick way to enable all features while disable debug
    is like this:

	./configure --enable-everything --disable-debug

    Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
    `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure' initial
    values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using a
    Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like this:

        CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

    Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:

        env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

    Or if you're using a non Bourne-compatible shell, you can do:

        sh -c 'CFLAGS="-O2 -g" ./configure'

3.  Set any other main preferences:

    Edit "src/feature.h"

    Edit "config.h" (Only if you didn't use ./configure)

    If you're cross-compiling, edit the following in "config.h"

        NO_XLOCALE
        SIZEOF_*    # sizeof some types
        R*INT*T     # types which are the same size
                    # as 16bit/32bit/pointer

4.  Build it (repeat step 2 as desired):

        make

5.  Install mrxvt :

        make install

    You may also want to install share/etc/mrxvt.terminfo and 
    share/etc/rxvt.termcap

6 a. If compiled with UTMP_SUPPORT but without utempter library support, you
     may need to install mrxvt with setuid root or setuid/setgid to match the
     file ownership and permissions on /etc/utmp (or /var/run/utmp).

6 b. You may need to install setuid root anyway for some systems so that they
     can give you ownership of the tty devices.


    ===================================

NB: SunOS (with/without gcc?) gets reported by configure as

        #undef STDC_HEADERS
        #define HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H 1

    but the ioctl() defines aren't protected against multiple inclusion, in
    this case by <termios.h> so use a hack in "feature.h" to avoid the problem.

    Gave up checking for `STDC_HEADERS', since they really should be there and
    I don't want to deal with the problems when they don't exist.

    SunOS users might complain to the right places and get their system headers
    fixed so that one day the rest of us won't have to keep compensating :(

    SVR4 users (that aren't using gcc) will have to add -DSVR4 to CPPFLAGS for
    configure.
