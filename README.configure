To disable a configure option, e.g., the debug option, run the
configure script as:
    $ ./configure --disable-debug
or
    $ ./configure --enable-debug=no


Here is the complete list of all available options of the configure
script:

--enable-everything
    add support for all enable options marked with an asterisk listed
    in "./configure --help".  Note that unlike other enable options
    this is order dependant.  You can specify this and then disable
    options which this enables by _following_ this with the appropriate
    commands.

--enable-minimal
	disable support for almost all enable options marked with an
	asterisk listed in "./configure --help". Note that unlike other
	enable options, this is order dependant. You can specify this
	and then enable options which this disables by _following_ this
	with the appropriate commands.

--enable-debug
    enable debug build of the program, which will build the program
    with debug symbols and slow down the performance.

--enable-ourstrings
    add support for our possibly faster memset() function and other
    various routines, overriding your system's versions which may
    have been hand-crafted in assembly or may require extra libraries
    to link in.  (This has header problems on some Linux systems).

--enable-frills
    add support for some lesser used features.
    
--enable-keepscrolling
    add support for continual scrolling of the display when you hold
    the mouse button down on a scrollbar arrow.

--enable-selectionscrolling
    add support to enable scrolling of the display when you select
    the text.

--enable-mousewheel
    add support for scrolling via mouse wheel or buttons 4 & 5.

--enable-mouseslipwheel
    add support for slip scrolling via mouse wheel or buttons 4 & 5.

--enable-rxvt-scroll
    add support for the original rxvt scrollbar.

--enable-next-scroll
    add support for a NeXT-like scrollbar.

--enable-half-shadow
    make shadows on the scrollbar only half the normal width & height.
    only applicable to rxvt scrollbars.

--enable-utmp
    write user and tty to utmp file (used by programs like ``w'') at
    start of rxvt execution and delete information when rxvt exits.

--enable-wtmp
    write user and tty to wtmp file (used by programs like ``last'') at
    start of rxvt execution and write logout when rxvt exits.  This
    option requires --enable-utmp to also be specified.

--enable-lastlog
    write user and tty to lastlog file (used by programs like
    ``lastlogin'') at start of rxvt execution.  This option requires
    --enable-utmp to also be specified.

--enable-utempter
	use utempter library to log the utmp and wtmp entries instead of
	our own version. Thus, the setuid root or setgid permission can
	be removed from mrxvt binary.

--enable-linespace
    add support to provide user specified line spacing between text
    rows.

--enable-24bits
    add support to 24 bits colors.

--enable-transparency

    Options are: "eucj" EUC Japanese encoding; "sjis" Shift JIS
    encoding; "big5" BIG5 encoding; "gb" GB encoding; "kr" EUC Korean
