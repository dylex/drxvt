- Extend menu language / facility. Multichar Xft support in menus. Sticky menus

- UTF-8 support

- Splitting window support

- I18N support

- Searching scroll buffer support

- Extensible timer support

- Reduce X resource usage, like Window, Pixmap, etc.
    2006-01-29 gi1242: Xresource usage (with or without transparency) is now
    down to some 20kb. I'm not sure how much more can be shaved of this ...

    2006-02-23 gi1242: Jimmy pointed out that we currently use one window for
    each VT. This is very wasteful, especially since we only display one window
    each time.

- Xterm style mouse support, e.g., joe 3.2

- PNG and JPEG background support on Solaris looks broken

- Reliable signal handling on SIGCHLD when multiple children exit at almost the
  same moment. According to APUE (Advanced Programming in UNIX Environment) 2nd
  Edition Chapter 10, sigaction () allows us to block reentry of a signal
  handler via its sa_mask parameter. But if a blocked signal occurs for
  multiple time during the signal handler, they are not queued. The OS will
  deliver the signal only once.

  	2006-02-23 gi1242: Possibly fixed. See comments in rxvt_Child_signal in
	main.c.

	2006-08-23 gi1242: Fixed! Our child handler now only sets a global
	variable. Further, we know we might miss a few SIGCHLD's, so when we
	get EIO errors after read(), we check to see if something died without
	telling us. We also flush the input buffer of dead childs, so the
	output is perfect ;)

- Show icon in tabs

- Add separate colors for tabbar background, menubar fg/bg


BUGS:

    1. mrxvt lockup! While waiting for an escape sequence to complete, mrxvt
       can not read any input from other tabs. This could lead to lockups:

	    mrxvt -ip 0,0 -e bash -c 'echo -ne "\e["; sleep 10

       Will make you wait 10 seconds before you can do anything on other tabs.

       WORK AROUND: Just type some text (or kill) the process in the first tab.
       If that doesn't work, press the ToggleHold macro after killing the
       process in the offending tab.

    2. Some functions are called from within rxvt_cmd_getc which should not be!
       For instance we can switch tabs inside rxvt_cmd_getc. This is not a good
       idea. For instance, if mrxvt is waiting for an escape sequence to
       complete (as above), then it will lead to incorrect output.

       NOTE: The above two bugs have been around since the first release of
       mrxvt. However have not been spotted until now! This is mainly because it
       is very unlikely you're going to stop half way through an escape
       sequence. Thus for normal use, these two bugs should not affect anyone.
       However we will try and fix it in the near future.
