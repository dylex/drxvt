- Extend menu language / facility. Multichar Xft support in menus. Sticky menus

- UTF-8 support

	2006-01-29 gi1242: Xresource usage (with or without transparency) is now
	down to some 20kb. I'm not sure how much more can be shaved of this ...

	2006-02-23 gi1242: Jimmy pointed out that we currently use one window for
	each VT. This is very wasteful, especially since we only display one window
	each time.

- Xterm style mouse support, e.g., joe 3.2

- PNG and JPEG background support on Solaris looks broken

- Reliable signal handling on SIGCHLD when multiple children exit at almost the
  same moment. According to APUE (Advanced Programming in UNIX Environment) 2nd
  Edition Chapter 10, sigaction () allows us to block reentry of a signal
  handler via its sa_mask parameter. But if a blocked signal occurs for
  multiple time during the signal handler, they are not queued. The OS will
  deliver the signal only once.

  	2006-02-23 gi1242: Possibly fixed. See comments in rxvt_Child_signal in
	main.c.

- Show icon in tabs

- Add separate colors for tabbar background, menubar fg/bg
