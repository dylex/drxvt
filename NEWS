Mrxvt version 0.5.1 is released! This release adds a new feature
of profile support, and makes lots of improvement to the new macro
feature. It also fixes lots of bugs. For details, check ChangeLog.
:-)


-----------------
04-09-2005

Mrxvt version 0.5.0 is released! After active development by our
new leading developer Gautam Iyer for more than three month, we
hereby present you this newest and best ever release of mrxvt.
This release has significantly improved performance and further
reduced resource usage even though mrxvt's footprint was already
very small. New features include but is not limited to: better
and intelligent tabbar apperance, full screen mode, new powerful
macros (replacing hotkeys), XRender alphablending, popup menus,
etc. Numerious bugs have been fixed as well. Please test it out
and send us bug reports, comments, suggestions, and of course
patchs.


-----------------
11-14-2005

Mrxvt version 0.4.2 is released! This is a bug fix release with
lots of fixes. Sorry I did not have much time to devote to the
development of mrxvt in the past months. So the new features,
like UTF-8, are still not available. If you are willing to help
on the development, please do not hesitate to let me know! 


-----------------
05-01-2005

Mrxvt version 0.4.1 is released! This is a bug fix release with
lots of fixes.


-----------------
02-25-2005

Mrxvt version 0.4.0 is released! This is the long awaited stable
release since there have been no more bug reports recently. ;-) 
This release fixes several minor bugs.


-----------------
02-06-2005

Mrxvt version 0.3.13 is released! This is a major bug fix release.
Sorry to disappoint you that we could not reach 0.4.0 right now.
I know you are eagerly waiting for the magic number 0.4.0. :p
The delay is because a major bug was found and thus we need more
test on the fix. In particular, please open multiple tabs
simultaneously and let each tab do some kind of busy job that
refreshes the screen constantly, e.g., `wget --progress=dot big.file`.
Then switch to another tab and work in it to see if there is any
misbehavior, like crashes (yes, not kidding ;-)), slow response
(expected if your machine is slow *_^), etc. If you meet crash,
please send me your mrxvt binary and coredump so that I can debug
it. Be sure to build mrxvt with debug support. I really hope 0.4.0
is rock solid so that I can concentrate on 0.5.x development branch
after releasing it.


-----------------
01-14-2005

Mrxvt version 0.3.12 is released! This is a major bug fix release
- see the long fix list in ChangeLog. If everything goes well, it
will be the last testing release before we reach 0.4.0.


-----------------
12-11-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.11 is released! This release is a major bug fix
release. Lots of problems are fixed, like compile error, terminal
hanging, off-focus fading bug, session crashes, etc. Please test
it throughly and report any bugs. If everything goes well, we will
release 0.3.12 as the last testing release (like 0.4.0 beta) and
reach 0.4.0 after that.


-----------------
12-05-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.10 is released! This release aims to be a bug fix
release, but some new features are added as well. The most significant
new feature is that the keyboard shortcuts are now configurable! So
if you do not like a default keyboard shortcut or would like to define
your own shortcuts, you can do it now in the configuration file. Sorry
we do not reach 0.4.0 at this release. Though I am using mrxvt
everyday and it seems pretty stable, I would like to delay a stable
release (0.4.0) till more people have throughly tested it.


-----------------
11-19-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.9 is released! This release is a bug fix release,
though some new features are still added as requested.


-----------------
11-09-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.8 is released! This release introduces the support
of true translucent window, holding exited terminal, input
broadcasting, different text shadow mode. It also fixes lots of bugs
(see the long ChangeLog). From now on, we will focus on stablizing
the code instead of adding significant new features. Hopefully we
can reach a stable branch at 0.4.0 very soon!


-----------------
11-08-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.8 is delayed since I found some serious bugs at
the last moment! Please do not worry. By fixing the bugs, I realize
now it is easy to implement some functionality, like broadcasting.
:-) But the scrolling has become horribly slow. I am trying to
figure out the reason. New release will come soon.


-----------------
10-31-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.7 is released! This release fixes XFT support of
CJK font and lots of bugs.


-----------------
10-22-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.6 is released! This release fixes XFT support and
many bugs. We are close to a stable release soon.


-----------------
10-15-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.5 is released! This release introduces the
experimental support of freetype font, utempter library and many
user convenience features, plus lots of fixes.


-----------------
10-10-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.4 is included in Gentoo Linux portage! I hope it
is stable enough for daily use now.


-----------------
10-08-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.4 is available! This release introduces the highly
anticipated session support, support of user supplied background
image for scrollbar/menubar, and gnome-terminal/konsole's hotkeys!
And there are lots of fixes and document updates.

features like text shadow!


-----------------
09-24-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.2 is available! This release fixes several serious
bugs, and introduces lots of new features! I hope it is stable enough
for daily use. I know there are too many releases recently, I will
reduce the frequency unless serious bugs are found. ;-)


-----------------
09-20-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.1 is available! This release adds back features
like off-focus fading and background color tinting. It also adds
new features like transparent scrollbar/menubar/tabbar.


-----------------
09-19-2004

Sorry folks, my sourceforge e-mail address listed in the AUTHORS/
configure.ac file of version 0.3.0 is wrong (fixed in CVS)! Please
refresh the project homepage and fetch the new e-mail address on
the left panel if you want to contact me! Thanks!


-----------------
09-15-2004

Mrxvt version 0.3.0 is available! This release is based on rxvt
2.7.11 CVS, so the name is changed to mrxvt in order to avoid
confusion with multi-aterm. Color background tinting is missing.
XIM support still needs debugging. But, it's usable now! Please
try it out and send me bug reports!
